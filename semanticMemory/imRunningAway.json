This document provides prioritized, step-by-step instructions to address identified opportunities in the Reconciliation Engine PoC, drawing directly from facts in semanticMemory files like pomernerian.json (e.g., Logback version conflicts in common, naas, orchestrator), common.json (e.g., 25 test failures across monitoring, security, resilience), naas.json (e.g., floating versions like '3.x' for Spring Boot), and unbearableTruth.json (e.g., 50-55% overall completion with atomic architecture). Emphasizes quick wins for POC stability without prod-level polish.",
    "executiveSummary": {
      "summary": "The Reconciliation Engine PoC demonstrates strong modular architecture (per unbearableTruth.json's atomic precision) with solid ETL in naas.json, pairing logic in orchestrator.json, and shared utilities in common.json. To reach 75-80% core completion, focus on these prioritized fixes for testing, dependencies, and securityâ€”leveraging kafkaSetup.yml's robust topics and pomernerian.json's clean hierarchies.",
      "keyOpportunities": [
        "**Enhance Test Reliability:** Address 25 failures in common.json (e.g., static mocking in DlqRouterTest) to achieve 90% coverage goal.",
        "**Standardize Dependencies:** Resolve Logback conflicts (1.5.18 parent vs 1.4.14 modules in pomernerian.json) and pin floating versions in naas.json.",
        "**Strengthen Security:** Secure MongoDB creds in atlasSetupReport.yaml and enforce InputSanitizer in naas.json's EtlService.",
        "**Complete Data Flows:** Implement recon metadata generation in matcher.json and escalation workflows in escalator.json.",
        "**Boost Observability:** Add metrics to reporter.json and monitor.json, building on common.json's Micrometer setup."
